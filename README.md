Pong plus weird hazards on the field

This is mainly a project allowing me to learn some game programming. It is the old pong game, but I've 
added a number of objects to the playing field that affect game play. (Eg: bumpers that the ball can
bounce off of, "warp" objects that will move the ball to another location, "capture" objects that hold
the ball and cause a new ball to get launched (thus - multi-ball play), etc.

An editor is included allowing the player to design a custom playing field.

The project is implemented using libGDX, and runs on the desktop and android. In android interstitial ads
are shown.
